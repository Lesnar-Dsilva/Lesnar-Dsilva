I am a proactive and detail-oriented individual with 6 years of experience in IT, specializing in self-taught skills such as Mathematics, Machine Learning, Robotics (Mechanics), MATLAB, and CAD. I excel at working independently, but I am also highly collaborative, capable of managing workloads and prioritizing tasks in time-sensitive environments. I thrive in challenging topics that expand my knowledge and expertise.
